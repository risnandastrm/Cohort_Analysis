Cohort is simply a subset of users grouped by shared characteristics. In the context of business analytics, a cohort usually refers to a subset of users specifically segmented by acquisition date (i.e. the first time a user visits website, etc). It breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.

Running a cohort analysis is one of the simplest ways to run an experiment for your business. As a marketer, you can run a time-bound campaign with certain characteristics you want to test: ad content, marketing channel, target audience, landing page design, etc. You can then compare metrics for reach, engagement, and conversion for these different marketing campaign, to see which factors make higher retention rate, and which didnâ€™t.
